# This is a demo of how we could use yaml files to help 'document' SSP elements to help 
# automate the usually considered 'manual review' tests when we need a more complex 
# data struture than attributes would allow and or when we just feel a file would 
# be a better place to list them.

- service_name: httpd-alpha
  port: 80
- service_name: httpd-beta
  port: 8080

# we can then write tests like:

#my_services = yaml(content: inspec.profile.file('services.yml')).params
#my_services.each do |s|
#  describe service(s['name']) do
#    it { should be_running }
#  end
#
#  describe port(s['port']) do
#    it { should be_listening }
#  end
#end
