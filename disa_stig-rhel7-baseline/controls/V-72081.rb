requirements are derived from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) 800-53 and related documents. Comments or proposed revisions

  title "The operating system must shut down upon audit processing failure, unless 
availability is an overriding concern. If availability is a concern, the system must 
alert the designated staff (System Administrator [SA] and Information System 
Security Officer [ISSO] at a minimum) in the event of an audit processing failure."
  desc  "
    It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk 
of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the 
security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, 
and system operation may be adversely affected.
    
    Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the 
audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
    
    This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct 
information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit 
storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories 
combined), or both.
    
    Satisfies: SRG-OS-000046-GPOS-00022, SRG-OS-000047-GPOS-0002.

Check to see what level \"auditctl\" is set to with following command: 

# auditctl -l | grep /-f
 -f 2

If the value of \"-f\" is set to \"2\", the system is configured to panic (shut 
down) in the event of an auditing failure.

If the value of \"-f\" is set to \"1\", the system is configured to only send 
information to the kernel log regarding the failure.

If the \"-f\" flag is not set, this is a CAT I finding.

If the \"-f\" flag is set to any value other than \"1\" or \"2\", this is a CAT II 
finding.

If the \"-f\" flag is set to \"1\" but the availability concern is not documented or 
there is no monitoring of the kernel log, this is a CAT III finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the operating system to shut down in the event of an audit 
processing failure.

Add or correct the option to shut down the operating system with the following 
command:

# auditctl -f 2

If availability has been determined to be more important, and this decision is 
documented with the ISSO, configure the operating system to notify system 
administration staff and ISSO staff in the event of an audit processing failure with 
the following command:

# auditctl -f 1

Kernel log monitoring must also be configured to properly alert designated staff.

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
