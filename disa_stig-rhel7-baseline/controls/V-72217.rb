  title "The operating system must limit the number of concurrent sessions to 10 for 
all accounts and/or account types."
  desc  "
    Operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users 
and user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed 
users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks related to DoS attacks.
    
    This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts 
and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system 
accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based on 
mission needs and the operational environment for each system.

all domains that have the \"maxlogins\" item assigned, this is a finding."
