  title "The operating system must protect against or limit the effects of Denial of 
Service (DoS) attacks by validating the operating system is implementing 
rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces."
  desc  "
    DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When 
this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate 
at degraded capacity.
    
    This requirement addresses the configuration of the operating system to mitigate 
the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. 
For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions 
for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some 
cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or 
establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, 
combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

Check the firewall configuration with the following command:

rule ipv4 filter IN_public_allow 0 -p tcp -m limit --limit 25/minute --limit-burst
