Check the configuration of \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\" for the cron facility with the 
following command:

Note: If another logging package is used, substitute the utility configuration file 
for \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\". 

# grep cron /etc/rsyslog.conf
cron.* /var/log/cron.log

If the command does not return a response, check for cron logging all facilities by 
inspecting the \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\" file:

# more /etc/rsyslog.conf

Look for the following entry:

*.* /var/log/messages

If \"rsyslog\" is not logging messages for the cron facility or all facilities, this 
is a finding.  

If the entry is in the \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\" file but is after the entry \"*.*\", 
this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure \"rsyslog\" to log all cron messages by adding or updating 
the following line to \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\":

cron.* /var/log/cron.log

Note: The line must be added before the following entry if it exists in 
\"/etc/rsyslog.conf\":

*.* ~ # discards everything"
