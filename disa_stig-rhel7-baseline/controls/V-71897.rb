    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and 
moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does 
not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on 
the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the 
vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has 
idled and take action to initiate the session lock.
    
    The screen package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured.
