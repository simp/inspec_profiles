Check the owner of all files and directories with the following command:

Note: The value after -fstype must be replaced with the filesystem type. XFS is used 
as an example.

# find / -xdev -fstype xfs -nouser

If any files on the system do not have an assigned owner, this is a finding."

have a valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned files and directories on
