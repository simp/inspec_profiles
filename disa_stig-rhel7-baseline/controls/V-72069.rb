Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed on the 
system with the following command:

# yum list installed aide

If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are 
performed on the system. 

If there is no application installed to perform file integrity checks, this is a 
finding.

Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the 
\"aide.conf\" file is under the \"/etc\" directory. 

Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

# find / -name aide.conf

Check the \"aide.conf\" file to determine if the \"acl\" rule has been added to the 
rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists.

An example rule that includes the \"acl\" rule is below:

All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
/bin All            # apply the custom rule to the files in bin 
/sbin All          # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin 

If the \"acl\" rule is not being used on all selection lines in the 
\"/etc/aide.conf\" file, or ACLs are not being checked by another file integrity 
tool, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the file integrity tool to check file and directory ACLs. 

If AIDE is installed, ensure the \"acl\" rule is present on all file and directory 
selection lists."
