  title "A file integrity tool must verify the baseline operating system 
configuration at least weekly."
  desc  "
    Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system 
vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. 
Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of 
which may be relevant to security.
    
    Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid 
unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of 
the operating system. The operating system's Information Management Officer 
(IMO)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) 
must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an 
unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment 
(AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed at least once per week.

Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:

# yum list installed aide

If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the 
system.

Check for the presence of a cron job running daily or weekly on the system that 
executes AIDE daily to scan for changes to the system baseline. The command used in 
the example will use a daily occurrence.

Check the \"/etc/cron.daily\" subdirectory for a \"crontab\" file controlling the 
execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on 
the system, use the following command:

# ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root        29 Nov  22  2015 aide

If the file integrity application does not exist, or a \"crontab\" file does not 
exist in the \"/etc/cron.daily\" or \"/etc/cron.weekly\" subdirectories, this is a 
finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the file integrity tool to automatically run on the system 
at least weekly. The following example output is generic. It will set cron to run 
AIDE daily, but other file integrity tools may be used:

# cat /etc/cron.daily/aide 
0 0 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s \"aide integrity check run for 
<system name>\" root@sysname.mil"
