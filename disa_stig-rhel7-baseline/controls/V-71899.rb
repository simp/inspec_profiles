  title "The operating system must initiate a session lock for the screensaver after 
a period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces."
  desc  "
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and 
moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does 
not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on 
the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the 
vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has 
idled and take action to initiate the session lock.
    
    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be 
determined and/or controlled.

If it is installed, GNOME must be configured to enforce a session lock after a 
15-minute delay. Check for the session lock settings with the following commands:

# grep -i  idle_activation_enabled /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*
[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]   idle-activation-enabled=true

If \"idle-activation-enabled\" is not set to \"true\", this is a finding."

Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not 
already exist) with the following command: 

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver

Add the setting to enable screensaver locking after 15 minutes of inactivity:

[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]

idle-activation-enabled=true"
