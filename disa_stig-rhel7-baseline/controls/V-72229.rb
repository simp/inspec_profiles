  title "The operating system must implement cryptography to protect the integrity 
of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) communications."
  desc  "
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by 
unauthorized users without detection.
    
    Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information 
include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling 
distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the 
confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash.

To determine if LDAP is being used for authentication, use the following command:

# grep -i useldapauth /etc/sysconfig/authconfig
USELDAPAUTH=yes

If USELDAPAUTH=yes, then LDAP is being used. 

Check for the directory containing X.509 certificates for peer authentication with 
the following command:

# grep -i cacertdir /etc/pam_ldap.conf
tls_cacertdir /etc/openldap/certs

Verify the directory set with the \"tls_cacertdir\" option exists.

If the directory does not exist or the option is commented out, this is a finding."

the integrity of LDAP remote access sessions.
