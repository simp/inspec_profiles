  title "Auditing must be configured to produce records containing information to 
establish what type of events occurred, where the events occurred, the source of the 
events, and the outcome of the events.

These audit records must also identify individual identities of group account users."
  desc  "
    Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult to 
establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.
    
    Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, 
for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process 
identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and 
access control or flow control rules invoked.
    
    Associating event types with detected events in the operating system audit logs 
provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or 
capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured operating system.
