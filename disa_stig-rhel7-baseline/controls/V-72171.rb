  title "All uses of the mount command must be audited."
  desc  "
    Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit 
records do not contain enough information.
    
    At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged 
mount commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to 
reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.
    
    Satisfies: SRG-OS-000042-GPOS-00020, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-0017.

Add or update the following rules in \"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules\" (removing 
those that do not match the CPU architecture):

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k 
privileged-mount

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
