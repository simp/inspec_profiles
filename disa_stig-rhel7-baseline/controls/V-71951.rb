  title "The delay between logon prompts following a failed console logon attempt 
must be at least four seconds."
  desc  "
    Configuring the operating system to implement organization-wide security 
implementation guides and security checklists verifies compliance with federal 
standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the 
most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements.
    
    Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in 
hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security 
posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related parameters are those 
parameters impacting the security state of the system, including the parameters 
required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters 
include, for example, registry settings; account, file, and directory permission 
settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote 
connections.
