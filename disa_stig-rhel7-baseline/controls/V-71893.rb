  title "The operating system must initiate a screensaver after a 15-minute period 
of inactivity for graphical user interfaces."
  desc  "
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and 
moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does 
not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on 
the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the 
vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has 
idled and take action to initiate the session lock.
    
    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be 
determined and/or controlled.

must be installed to lock sessions on the console.

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not 
Applicable.

Check to see if GNOME is configured to display a screensaver after a 15 minute delay 
with the following command:

# grep -i idle-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*
idle-delay=uint32 900

If the \"idle-delay\" setting is missing or is not set to \"900\" or less, this is a 
finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the operating system to initiate a screensaver after a 
15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces.

Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not 
already exist) with the following command:

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver

Edit “org/gnome/desktop/session” and add or update the following lines:

# Set the lock time out to 900 seconds before the session is considered idle
idle-delay=uint32 900

Edit \"org/gnome/desktop/screensaver\" and add or update the following lines:

# Set this to true to lock the screen when the screensaver activates
lock-enabled=true
# Set the lock timeout to 180 seconds after the screensaver has been activated
lock-delay=uint32 180

You must include the \"uint32\" along with the integer key values as shown.

Override the user's setting and prevent the user from changing it by editing 
“/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/screensaver” and adding or updating the following lines:

# Lock desktop screensaver settings
/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay
/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-enabled
/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-delay

Update the system databases:

# dconf update

Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect."
