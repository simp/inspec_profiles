    Firewalls protect computers from network attacks by blocking or limiting access 
to open network ports. Application firewalls limit which applications are allowed to 
communicate over the network.

Check to see if \"firewalld\" is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed firewalld
firewalld-0.3.9-11.el7.noarch.rpm

If the \"firewalld\" package is not installed, ask the System Administrator if 
another firewall application (such as iptables) is installed. 

If an application firewall is not installed, this is a finding. 

Check to see if the firewall is loaded and active with the following command:

# systemctl status firewalld
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon

   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2014-06-17 11:14:49 CEST; 5 days ago

If \"firewalld\" does not show a status of \"loaded\" and \"active\", this is a 
finding. 

Check the state of the firewall:

# firewall-cmd --state 
running

If \"firewalld\" does not show a state of \"running\", this is a finding."

Install the \"firewalld\" package, if it is not on the system, with the following

# yum install firewalld

Start the firewall via \"systemctl\" with the following command:

# systemctl start firewalld"
