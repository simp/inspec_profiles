  tag "check": "If there is an HBSS with a Device Control Module and a Data Loss 
Prevention mechanism, this requirement is not applicable.

Verify the operating system disables the ability to use USB mass storage devices.

Check to see if USB mass storage is disabled with the following command:

#grep -i usb-storage /etc/modprobe.d/*

install usb-storage /bin/true

If the command does not return any output, and use of USB storage devices is not 
documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational 
requirement, this is a finding."

Create a file under \"/etc/modprobe.d\" with the following command:

#touch /etc/modprobe.d/nousbstorage

install usb-storage /bin/true"
