  title "The operating system must implement cryptography to protect the integrity 
of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) communications."
  desc  "
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by 
unauthorized users without detection.
    
    Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information 
include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling 
distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the 
confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash.

To determine if LDAP is being used for authentication, use the following command:

# grep -i useldapauth /etc/sysconfig/authconfig
USELDAPAUTH=yes

If USELDAPAUTH=yes, then LDAP is being used.

Check that the path to the X.509 certificate for peer authentication with the 
following command:

# grep -i cacertfile /etc/pam_ldap.conf
tls_cacertfile /etc/openldap/ldap-cacert.pem

Verify the \"tls_cacertfile\" option points to a file that contains the trusted CA 
certificate.

If this file does not exist, or the option is commented out or missing, this is a 
finding."
