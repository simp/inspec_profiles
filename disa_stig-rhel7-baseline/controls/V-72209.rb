If there are no lines in the \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\" file that contain the \"@\" or 
\"@@\" symbol(s), and the lines with the correct symbol(s) to send output to another 
system do not cover all \"rsyslog\" output, ask the System Administrator to indicate 
how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or media. 

If there is no evidence that the audit logs are being sent to another system, this 
is a finding."
