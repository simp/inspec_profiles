  title "The Network File System (NFS) must be configured to use RPCSEC_GSS."
  desc  "When an NFS server is configured to use RPCSEC_SYS, a selected userid and 
groupid are used to handle requests from the remote user. The userid and groupid 
could mistakenly or maliciously be set incorrectly. The RPCSEC_GSS method of 
authentication uses certificates on the server and client systems to more securely 
authenticate the remote mount request."

To check if the system is importing an NFS file system, look for any entries in the 
\"/etc/fstab\" file that have a file system type of \"nfs\" with the following 
command:

# cat /etc/fstab | grep nfs
192.168.21.5:/mnt/export /data1 nfs4 rw,sync ,soft,sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p

If the system is mounting file systems via NFS and has the sec option without the 
\"krb5:krb5i:krb5p\" settings, the \"sec\" option has the \"sys\" setting, or the 
\"sec\" option is missing, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Update the \"/etc/fstab\" file so the option \"sec\" is defined for 
each NFS mounted file system and the \"sec\" option does not have the \"sys\" 
setting. 

Ensure the \"sec\" option is defined as \"krb5:krb5i:krb5p\"."
