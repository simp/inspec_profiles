exist, the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working 
directory upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would 
not be able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them 
visibility to system files they normally would not be able to access."

the system exists.

Check the home directory assignment for all local interactive non-privileged users 
on the system with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep \":[1-9][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$\"
smithj /home/smithj

Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged UID. 
Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing 
system logon information.

Check that all referenced home directories exist with the following command:

# pwck -r
user 'smithj': directory '/home/smithj' does not exist

If any home directories referenced in \"/etc/passwd\" are returned as not defined, 
this is a finding."

do not have a home directory assigned. Use the following commands to create the user 
home directory assigned in \"/etc/ passwd\":

Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of 
\"/home/smithj\", a UID of \"smithj\", and a Group Identifier (GID) of \"users 
assigned\" in \"/etc/passwd\".

# mkdir /home/smithj 
# chown smithj /home/smithj
