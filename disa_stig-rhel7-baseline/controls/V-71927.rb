  title "Passwords must be restricted to a 24 hours/1 day minimum lifetime."
  desc  "Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password 
changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If users 
are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, the password could 
be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the organization's policy 
regarding password reuse."
