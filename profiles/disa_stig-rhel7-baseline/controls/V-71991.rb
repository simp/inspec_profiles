  title "The operating system must enable the SELinux targeted policy."
  desc  "
    Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not
operate correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as
the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for
enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data
on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not
limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e.,
permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion
detection parameters.

    This requirement applies to operating systems performing security function
verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.
