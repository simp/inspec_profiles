  desc  "
    Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because attackers 
may exploit an inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected access to the 
system. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their 
user account has been obtained.
    
    Operating systems need to track periods of inactivity and disable application 
identifiers after zero days of inactivity.
