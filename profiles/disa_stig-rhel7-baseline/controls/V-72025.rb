directory are group-owned by a group the user is a member of.

Check the group owner of all files and directories in a local interactive user’s 
home directory with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user \"smithj\", who has a home directory of 
\"/home/smithj\".

# ls -lLR /<home directory>/<users home directory>/
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1

-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj sa        231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

If any files are found with an owner different than the group home directory user, 
check to see if the user is a member of that group with the following command:

# grep smithj /etc/group
sa:x:100:juan,shelley,bob,smithj 
smithj:x:521:smithj

If the user is not a member of a group that group owns file(s) in a local 
interactive user’s home directory, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Change the group of a local interactive user’s files and directories 
to a group that the interactive user is a member of. To change the group owner of a 
local interactive user’s files and directories, use the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of 
\"/home/smithj\" and is a member of the users group.

# chgrp users /home/smithj/<file>"
