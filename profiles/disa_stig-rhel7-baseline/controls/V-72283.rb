  title "The system must not forward Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) 
source-routed packets."
  desc  "Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest that 
routers forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, 
which can be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only 
to the forwarding of source-routed traffic, such as when IPv4 forwarding is enabled 
and the system is functioning as a router."
