  title "The cryptographic hash of system files and commands must match vendor
values."
  desc  "
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, system command and files can be
altered by unauthorized users without detection.

    Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information
include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling
distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the
confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash.
