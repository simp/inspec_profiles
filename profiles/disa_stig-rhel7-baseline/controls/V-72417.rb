This Security Technical Implementation Guide is published as a tool to improve
the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. The
requirements are derived from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) 800-53 and related documents. Comments or proposed revisions

    Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate from the
    information system, ensures that even if the information system is compromised, that
    compromise will not affect credentials stored on the authentication device.

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems
    gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or
    challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government
    Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common Access Card.

    A privileged account is defined as an information system account with
    authorizations of a privileged user.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized
    user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
    non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example,
    dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the
    function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g., VPN,
    proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of
    configuring the device itself (management).

    Requires further clarification from NIST.
