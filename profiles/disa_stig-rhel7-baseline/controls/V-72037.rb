  title "Local initialization files must not execute world-writable programs."
  desc  "If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in 
unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user files or 
otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is compromised at 
the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually compromise the 
system at the root and network level."
