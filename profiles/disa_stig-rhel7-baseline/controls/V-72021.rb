Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users on the system with 
the following command:

Note: This may miss local interactive users that have been assigned a privileged 
UID. Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files 
containing system logon information.

# ls -ld $ (egrep ':[0-9]{4}' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f6)

Check the user's primary group with the following command:

# grep users /etc/group
users:x:250:smithj,jonesj,jacksons

\"/home/smithj\", and has a primary group of users.

# chgrp users /home/smithj"
