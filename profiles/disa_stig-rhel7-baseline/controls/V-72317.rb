Check to see if \"libreswan\" is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed libreswan
openswan-2.6.32-27.el6.x86_64

If \"libreswan\" is installed, check to see if the \"IPsec\" service is active with 
the following command:

# systemctl status ipsec
ipsec.service - Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)

If the \"IPsec\" service is active, check to see if any tunnels are configured in 
\"/etc/ipsec.conf\" and \"/etc/ipsec.d/\" with the following commands:

# grep -i conn /etc/ipsec.conf
conn mytunnel

# grep -i conn /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf
conn mytunnel

If there are indications that a \"conn\" parameter is configured for a tunnel, ask 
the System Administrator if the tunnel is documented with the ISSO. If \"libreswan\" 
is installed, \"IPsec\" is active, and an undocumented tunnel is active, this is a 
finding."
