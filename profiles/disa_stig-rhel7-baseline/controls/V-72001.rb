application, or user account.

Obtain the list of authorized system accounts from the Information System Security 
Officer (ISSO).

Check the system accounts on the system with the following command:

# more /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync

halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt
games:x:12:100:games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin
gopher:x:13:30:gopher:/var/gopher:/sbin/nologin

Accounts such as \"games\" and \"gopher\" are not authorized accounts as they do not 
support authorized system functions. 

If the accounts on the system do not match the provided documentation, or accounts 
that do not support an authorized system function are present, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the system so all accounts on the system are assigned to an 
active system, application, or user account. 

Remove accounts that do not support approved system activities or that allow for a 
normal user to perform administrative-level actions. 

Document all authorized accounts on the system."
