  title "All privileged function executions must be audited."
  desc  "Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised
information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have
significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged
functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider
threats and the advanced persistent threat."

All \"setuid\" and \"setgid\" files on the system must have a corresponding audit
rule, or must have an audit rule for the (sub) directory that contains the
\"setuid\"/\"setgid\" file.

If all \"setuid\"/\"setgid\" files on the system do not have audit rule coverage,
this is a finding."

For each \"setuid\"/\"setgid\" program on the system, which is not covered by an
audit rule for a (sub) directory (such as \"/usr/sbin\"), add a line of the

the full path to each \"setuid\"/\"setgid\" program in the list:
