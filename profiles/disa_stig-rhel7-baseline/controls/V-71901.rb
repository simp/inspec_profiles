  title "The operating system must initiate a session lock for graphical user 
interfaces when the screensaver is activated."
  desc  "
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and 
moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does 
not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on 
the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the 
vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has 
idled and take action to initiate the session lock.
    
    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be 
determined and/or controlled.

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not 
Applicable.

If GNOME is installed, check to see a session lock occurs when the screensaver is 
activated with the following command:

# grep -i lock-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*
lock-delay=uint32 5

If the \"lock-delay\" setting is missing, or is not set, this is a finding."

graphical user interfaces when a screensaver is activated.

Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not 
already exist) with the following command: 

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver

Add the setting to enable session locking when a screensaver is activated:

[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]
lock-delay=uint32 5

After the setting has been set, run dconf update."
