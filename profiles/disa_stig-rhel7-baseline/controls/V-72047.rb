    If a world-writable directory has the sticky bit set and is not group-owned by a 
privileged Group Identifier (GID), unauthorized users may be able to modify files 
created by others.
    
    The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied 
with the system or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is 
normally reserved for directories used by the system and by users for temporary file 
storage, (e.g., /tmp), and for directories requiring global read/write access.

as an example.
