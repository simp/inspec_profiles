non-privileged local interactive user home directories.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users (those with a UID
greater than 1000) on the system with the following command:

#cut -d: -f 1,3,6,7 /etc/passwd | egrep \":[1-4][0-9]{3}\" | tr \":\" \"\\t\"

adamsj /home/adamsj /bin/bash
jacksonm /home/jacksonm /bin/bash
smithj /home/smithj /bin/bash

The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home
directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, /home) and
usersâ€™ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered
interactive users.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged
interactive users with the following command:

Note: The partition of /home is used in the example.

# grep /home /etc/fstab
UUID=333ada18    /home                   ext4    noatime,nobarrier,nodev  1 2

If a separate entry for the file system/partition that contains the non-privileged
interactive users' home directories does not exist, this is a finding."
