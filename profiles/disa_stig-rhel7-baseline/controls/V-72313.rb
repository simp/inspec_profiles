  title "SNMP community strings must be changed from the default."
  desc  "Whether active or not, default Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
community strings must be changed to maintain security. If the service is running 
with the default authenticators, anyone can gather data about the system and the 
network and use the information to potentially compromise the integrity of the 
system or network(s). It is highly recommended that SNMP version 3 user 
authentication and message encryption be used in place of the version 2 community 
strings."

If either of these commands returns any output, this is a finding."
