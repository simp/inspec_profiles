  title "File systems that are being imported via Network File System (NFS) must be
mounted to prevent binary files from being executed."
  desc  "The \"noexec\" mount option causes the system to not execute binary files.
This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved binary
files as they may be incompatible. Executing files from untrusted file systems
increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized
administrative access."

Find the file system(s) that contain the directories being exported with the
following command:

# more /etc/fstab | grep nfs

UUID=e06097bb-cfcd-437b-9e4d-a691f5662a7d    /store           nfs

If a file system found in \"/etc/fstab\" refers to NFS and it does not have the
\"noexec\" option set, and use of NFS exported binaries is not documented with the
Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a
finding."

systems that are being exported via NFS."
