  title "The operating system must enable SELinux."
  desc  "
    Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not 
operate correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as 
the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for 
enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data 
on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not 
limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., 
permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion 
detection parameters.
    
    This requirement applies to operating systems performing security function 
verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.
