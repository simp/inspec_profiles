  title "The umask must be set to 077 for all local interactive user accounts."
  desc  "The umask controls the default access mode assigned to newly created files. 
A umask of 077 limits new files to mode 700 or less permissive. Although umask can 
be represented as a four-digit number, the first digit representing special access 
modes is typically ignored or required to be \"0\". This requirement applies to the 
globally configured system defaults and the local interactive user defaults for each 
account on the system."

\"077\".

Identify the locations of all local interactive user home directories by looking at 
the \"/etc/passwd\" file.

Check all local interactive user initialization files for interactive users with the 
following command:

Note: The example is for a system that is configured to create users home 
directories in the \"/home\" directory.

# grep -i umask /home/*/.*

If any local interactive user initialization files are found to have a umask 
statement that has a value less restrictive than \"077\", this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Remove the umask statement from all local interactive users’ 
initialization files. 

If the account is for an application, the requirement for a umask less restrictive 
than \"077\" can be documented with the Information System Security Officer, but the 
user agreement for access to the account must specify that the local interactive 
user must log on to their account first and then switch the user to the application 
account with the correct option to gain the account’s environment variables."
