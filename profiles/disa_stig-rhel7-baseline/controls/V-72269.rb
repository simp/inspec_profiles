  title "The operating system must, for networked systems, synchronize clocks with a 
server that is synchronized to one of the redundant United States Naval Observatory 
(USNO) time servers, a time server designated for the appropriate DoD network 
(NIPRNet/SIPRNet), and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS)."
  desc  "
    Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead 
to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred 
on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system 
events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be 
inaccurate.
    
    Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time 
stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected 
over a network.
    
    Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the 
authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints).

If NTP is not running, this is a finding.

If the process is found, then check the \"ntp.conf\" file for the \"maxpoll\" option 
setting:

# grep maxpoll /etc/ntp.conf

maxpoll 17

If the option is set to \"17\" or is not set, this is a finding.

If the file does not exist, check the \"/etc/cron.daily\" subdirectory for a crontab 
file controlling the execution of the \"ntpdate\" command.

# grep â€“l ntpdate /etc/cron.daily

# ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide

If a crontab file does not exist in the \"/etc/cron.daily\" that executes the 
\"ntpdate\" file, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Edit the \"/etc/ntp.conf\" file and add or update an entry to define 
\"maxpoll\" to \"10\" as follows:

maxpoll 10

If NTP was running and \"maxpoll\" was updated, the NTP service must be restarted:

# systemctl restart ntpd

If NTP was not running, it must be started:

# systemctl start ntpd"
