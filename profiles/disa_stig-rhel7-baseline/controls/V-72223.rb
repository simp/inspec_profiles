  title "All network connections associated with a communication session must be 
terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity from the user 
at a command prompt, except to fulfill documented and validated mission 
requirements."
  desc  "
    Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of 
opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session 
enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, 
quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the 
managed network element. 
    
    Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions 
includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the 
operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application 
level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level 
network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all 
sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the 
resources associated with that session.
