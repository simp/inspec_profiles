  title "Designated personnel must be notified if baseline configurations are 
changed in an unauthorized manner."
  desc  "
    Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system 
vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. 
Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of 
which may be relevant to security.
    
    Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid 
unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of 
the operating system. The operating system's Information Management Officer 
(IMO)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) 
must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an 
unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.

Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment 
(AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed and notify specified individuals 
via email or an alert.

Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:

# yum list installed aide

If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the 
system. 

Check for the presence of a cron job running routinely on the system that executes 
AIDE to scan for changes to the system baseline. The commands used in the example 
will use a daily occurrence.

Check the \"/etc/cron.daily\" subdirectory for a \"crontab\" file controlling the 
execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on 
the system, use the following commands:

# ls -al /etc/cron.daily | grep aide
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root        32 Jul  1  2011 aide

AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so the cron job 
uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity 
run as in the following example:

# more /etc/cron.daily/aide
0 0 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s \"$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity 
check run\" root@sysname.mil

If the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, 
this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the operating system to notify designated personnel if 
baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner. The AIDE tool can be 
configured to email designated personnel through the use of the cron system.  

The following example output is generic. It will set cron to run AIDE daily and to 
send email at the completion of the analysis. 

# more /etc/cron.daily/aide
0 0 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s \"$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity 
check run\" root@sysname.mil"
