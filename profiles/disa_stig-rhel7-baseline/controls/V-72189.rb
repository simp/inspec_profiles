  title "All uses of the delete_module command must be audited."
  desc  "
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission
needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and
investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for
one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the information
system (e.g., module or policy filter).

    Satisfies: SRG-OS-000471-GPOS-00216, SRG-OS-000477-GPOS-0022.

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit
architectures. Only the line appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i delete_module /etc/audit/audit.rules

If the command does not return the following output (appropriate to the
architecture), this is a finding.

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S delete_module -k module-change

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S delete_module -k module-change

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."

successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the \"delete_module\" command occur.

Add or update the following rules in \"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules\" (removing
those that do not match the CPU architecture):

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S delete_module -k module-change

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S delete_module -k module-change

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
