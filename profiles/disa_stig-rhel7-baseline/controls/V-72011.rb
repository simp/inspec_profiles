Check for missing local interactive user home directories with the following command:

user 'lp': directory '/var/spool/lpd' does not exist
user 'news': directory '/var/spool/news' does not exist
user 'uucp': directory '/var/spool/uucp' does not exist
user 'smithj': directory '/home/smithj' does not exist

Ask the System Administrator (SA) if any users found without home directories are 
local interactive users. If the SA is unable to provide a response, check for users 
with a User Identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep \":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$\"

If any interactive users do not have a home directory assigned, this is a finding."

do not have a home directory assigned."
